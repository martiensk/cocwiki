# Mythos Tomes
Mythos tomes have two values for cthulhu mythos:
* CMI - Points given for initial reading.
* CMF - Points given for a full reading. 
## Determine language
If the language can be determined and the party can read it, an initial reading can be made. Otherwise the investigators will have to get it translated / get an interpreter.
## Initial Reading
The player must make a reading roll in the appropriate language.
* **Regular difficulty**: A book printed within the last century and in good condition.
* **Hard difficulty**: A old, handwritten book.
* **Extreme difficulty**: The most challenging of ancient, moldering tomes, containing a mix of print and handwritten annotation.
If the initial reading succeeds, the reader loses the sanity. Unbelievers do not lose the sanity immediately, only once they become believers.
The reader would have a good idea of how a full study of the book would take.
## Full study
* If the readers Mythos skill is below the CMF, the user gains the CMF. Otherwise the user gains the CMI.
* A sanity roll should be made to determine if the user gets the same sanity loss.
* A book may be studied more than once, each time the study time should be doubled.
## As a reference
* After a full study, it's cthulhu mythos rating determines it's usefulness as a reference to identify mythos related things.
* An investigator can spend 1d4 hours reading the book, then roll 1d100 against the books cthulhu mythos rating. If success, the reader may get some info.
* A mythos tome may increase another skill (like language) by 1d6 or 1d10.
## Occult Tomes
Can be used like mythos tomes. Can contain non-mythos spells and can cost sanity points, but may not yeild any cthulhu mythos points.
