# MP
MP is equal to one fifth of POW.
Casting spells cost MP or POW. Using it may leave behind a sensation. (such as regret mixed with pleasure)
Using POW should cause a stronger sensation than using MP.
If the character has no MP left, HO can be used. It will have physical signs, such as blood from the eyes.
MP is regenerated at 1 per hour (2 if POW is over 100, 3 if POW is over 200 and so on).
