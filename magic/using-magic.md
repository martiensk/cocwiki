# MP
MP is equal to one fifth of POW.
Casting spells cost MP or POW. Using it may leave behind a sensation. (such as regret mixed with pleasure)
Using POW should cause a stronger sensation than using MP.
If the character has no MP left, HO can be used. It will have physical signs, such as blood from the eyes.
MP is regenerated at 1 per hour (2 if POW is over 100, 3 if POW is over 200 and so on). 
# Casting
Casting a spell incurs the spell's sanity loss.
Spells time are variant, they may require ritual. 
When casting a new spell for the first time a casting roll must be made.
## Casting roll
Roll **Hard POW**. 
If successful the spell is cast.
If failed a second attempt (now or in future) may be made. This always constitutes a pushed roll.
If failed [dire consequences](pushed-casting-fails) ensue.
# POW
If a spell calling for an opposed POW roll succeeds, the investigators must make a POW upgrade roll (1d100) - if it succeeds POW can be upgraded by 1d10.
