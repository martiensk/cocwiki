<!-- TITLE: Learning Magic -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Not the Hogwarts kind -->
Sanity loss does not occur when you learn a spell, but does when you use it.
# Books
Spells are discovered during the initial reading and can be learnt.
Learning spells from books typically takes 2d6 weeks.
After this time learning the spell costs a successful INT roll (may be pushed).
# From a person
Learning from a person is faster, 1d8 days.
# From an entity
A mythos entity may supply a book or scroll, but more commonly teach via dreams.
This may take minutes or months, and incurs 1d6 sanity loss.
A successful INT roll can be made to retain the knowledge.
