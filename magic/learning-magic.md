# Mythos Tomes
Mythos tomes have two values for cthulhu mythos:
* CMI - Points given for initial reading.
* CMF - Points given for a full reading. 
## Determine language
If the language can be determined and the party can read it, an initial reading can be made. Otherwise the investigators will have to get it translated / get an interpreter.
## Initial Reading
The player must make a reading roll in the appropriate language.
* **Regular difficulty**: A book printed within the last century and in good condition.
* **Hard difficulty**: A old, handwritten book.
* **Extreme difficulty**: The most challenging of ancient, moldering tomes, containing a mix of print and handwritten annotation.
