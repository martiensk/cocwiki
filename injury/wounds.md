# Injury and first aid
## Regular damage
* If HP is reduced to zero, the character is unconscious. 
* A character cannot die from regular damage.
* Luck may be spent to remain conscious, costing 1 point on first round and doubling each consecutive round.
## Major wound
* Character falls prone
* Make **CON** check to see if character stays conscious.
* If HP is reduced to zero, the character is **dying**. 
## Dying
* Make a CON roll after each round. If failed, die.
* To stabilize **First aid** must be applied successfully.
* After each hour, roll CON. If failed you are dying again.
* If medicine is applied successfully heal 1d3 and remove dying status.
## First aid and medicine
Both can be applied once up to one hour after injury, first aid healing 1 HP (1d4 pulp) and medicine 1d3 (1d4 pulp).
# Recovery
## Regular damage
Recover 1 (2 pulp) HP per day.
## Major Wound
At the end of each week, make a CON roll.
**Fumble:** Add permanent side effect.
**Fail:** Do not recover.
**Success:** Recover 1d3 HP.
**Extreme success:** Recover 2d3 and remove major wound.
* **Bonus die** if resting in comfortable environment.
* If under medical care, at end of week doc must make medicine roll. If success, add bonus die. (If fumble, add penalty die.)
* **Penalty die** if in poor environment.
The major wound is healed when character rolls extreme success on CON roll or if HP recovers to half of total.
