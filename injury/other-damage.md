Injury | Damage | Examples
--- | --- | ---
**Minor:** a person could survive numerous occurrences of this level of damage. | 1D3 | Punch, kick, head-butt, mild acid, breathing smoky atmosphere*, a thrown fist-size rock, falling (per 10 feet) onto soft swamp.
**Moderate:** might cause a major wound; it would take a few such attacks to kill. | 1D6 | Falling (per 10 feet) onto grass, club, strong acid, breathing water*, exposure to vacuum*, small caliber bullet, arrow, fire (burning torch).
**Severe:** likely to cause a major wound. One or two occurrences would render a person unconscious or dead. | 1D10 | .38 caliber bullet, falling (per 10 feet) onto concrete, axe, fire (flamethrower, running through a burning room), being 6 to 9 yards from an exploding hand grenade or stick of dynamite, a mild poison**.
**Deadly:** the average person has a 50% chance of dying. | 2D10 | Hit by a car at 30mph, being 3 to 6 yards from an exploding hand grenade or stick of dynamite, a strong poison**.
**Terminal:** outright death is likely. | 4D10 | Hit by a speeding car, being within 3 yards of an exploding hand grenade or stick of dynamite, a lethal poison**.
**Splat:** outright death almost certain. | 8D10 | Being involved in a high-speed head-on collision, being hit by a train.
*Asphyxiation and Drowning: a CON roll should be made each round; once a CON roll is failed, damage is sustained each
round thereafter until death or until the victim is able to breathe. If the character is in a state of physical exertion, a Hard success
is required on the CON roll.
**Poisons: an Extreme CON roll will halve damage from poisons. Poisons may cause a variety of additional symptoms
including: stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, sweats, cramps, jaundice, altered heart rate, impaired vision, convul-
sions, unconsciousness, and paralysis. It is up to the Keeper whether the symptoms permit the victim to act or not, or to
act with a penalty die or an increased level of difficulty.
In certain circumstances, Keepers may allow a poison's effects to be shaken off if the CON roll is a critical success.
