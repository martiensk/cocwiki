# Initiative
Make DEX roll, higher level of success goes first. For characters that rolled the same success level, higher DEX goes first.

# One combat round
* Investigators get one action per round.
* Investigators may elect to delay taking an action until later in the round.
# Armour
Reduce damage of any attack that goes through armour by the armour rating. (Unless attacks ignore armour, ike magic)
# Outnumbered
A character/monster can make as many dodge/fight back rolls as they have actions per round available to them. After that, all dodge/fight back rolls must be made with a penalty dice.
# Escaping
If unobstructed a character may use his action to flee.
# Extreme damage, impales
If attacker has an extreme success on his turn (not fighting back):
* If attacking with **blunt** weapon, deal **maximum damage** plus **maximum bonus damage**.
* If attacking with an **impaling** weapon (spear, bullets), deal **maximum damage** plus **maximum bonus damage** and make an additional **damage roll**.
