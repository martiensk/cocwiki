# Ranged or thrown weapons
The traget has the option of diving for cover.
A target may make a Dodge roll against a *thrown* weapon.
A target may choose to *Fight Back* if within *one fifth of their DEX* in feet to the attacker.
Half the attacker’s damage bonus is applied to thrown and missile weapons that rely on the user’s strength—this applies to bows and slings but not to crossbows.
