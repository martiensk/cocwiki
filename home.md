> The universe is older, bigger and weirder than anyone could ever imagine. Mankind is insignificant.
There is no good or evil, or any other ordering structure that man can grasp except power.
And people who glimpse a shadow of these old powers are like a snowflake in a furnace
**- H.P. Lovecraft**

*"At night the most mundane circumstances can construct demons in our minds, and those demons kill.
This creates and overlap, an ambiguity, and anyone caught in this paradox will either fashion his own demise 
out of fear and mistrust, or explain away the percieved threat only to then be overcome by it."*
**- Edgar Allan Poe**

*"There is infinite beauty and truth to be found in the most unlikely and revolting places.
But unable to overcome fear and revulsion man cannot grasp that wisdom and
himself becomes the monster in his efforts to protect against them."*
**- Mary Shelley**
