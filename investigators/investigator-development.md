<!-- TITLE: Investigator Development Phase -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Let's up them skills, yo -->

# Levelling skills
When an investigator successfully uses a skill in play, the player should check the box beside that skill on the investigator sheet.
No tick is earned if the roll used a bonus die. In the case of an opposed roll  only the winner may tick their skill.
### Luck
Investigators should always roll for luck.
# Development Phase
The phase occurs at the end of a scenario/campaign chapter.
For each skill check the player rolls 1D100.
If the player rolls higher than the current skill number, or the result is over 95, then the investigator improves in that skill.
Roll 1d10 and add the result to the skill level.

**Note:** *The Cthulhu Mythos and Credit Rating skills never receive a skill check.*
