<!-- TITLE: Rules and Mechanics -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: I'm not crazy, I swear! -->
# Pointers
* Bonus/penalty die are not applied to sanity rolls. Sanity rolls can't be adjusted by spending luck.
* **Fails** cause investigator to lose control for a moment.
	* **Jump in fright:** Causing the investigator to drop something (spectacles, flashlight, gun, book, etc.)
	* **Cry out in terror:** Drawing attention, saying something inappropriate.
	* **Involuntary movement:** Swerving the steering wheel dangerously to one side, throwing up one’s hands in horror, cringing.
	* **Involuntary combat action:** If a Sanity roll is failed during a combat round, the investigator’s action for that round may be dictated by the Keeper; for example, lashing out with a fist, squeezing a trigger, taking shelter behind someone else.
	* **Freeze:** Stare disbelievingly for a moment but take no action.
* **Fumbles** cause investigators to lose maximum points.
* If the player loses **5** or more sanity points in a **single roll**, he/she incurs **temporary insanity**.
* If the player loses **one fifth** of their sanity in a **single day game** he/she incurs **indefinite insanity**.
# Phases of insanity
1. Bout of madness: *Player loses control of character for brief period of time.*
2. Underlying insanity: *Player is prone to bouts of madness, phobias, delusions.*
3. Recovery
### Bout of madness
* Lasts for 1d10 combat rounds, or can be played out if not in combat/company.
* Bouts of madness should add new backstory entries, or corrupt existing ones.
### Underlying Insanity
Any sanity point loss causes another bout of madness. Player may rollplay this insanity.
A **psychoanalysis roll** may be used to ignore a **phobia / mania**.
A **psychoanalysis roll** or **sanity roll** may be used to see through **delusions / hallucinations**.
A **failed roll** lose 1 sanity and go into a bout of madness.
# Temporary Insanity
Happens if the player loses 5 or more points of insanity in a single roll.
Player must make an **INT** roll.
If **failed**, player does not go insane.
If **passed**, the player goes insane for **1d10** hours.
# Indefinite Insanity
Happens if player loses more than a fifth of their sanity in a single game day.
Lasts until the player is cured or recovers.
# Permanent Insanity
If sanity drops to zero the character is permanently and indefinitely insane, and ceases to be a player character.
