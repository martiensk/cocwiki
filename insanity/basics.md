# Pointers
* Bonus/penalty die are not applied to sanity rolls. Sanity rolls can't be adjusted by spending luck.
* **Fails** cause investigator to lose control for a moment.
	* **Jump in fright:** Causing the investigator to drop something (spectacles, flashlight, gun, book, etc.)
	* **Cry out in terror:** Drawing attention, saying something inappropriate.
	* **Involuntary movement:** Swerving the steering wheel dangerously to one side, throwing up one’s hands in horror, cringing.
	* **Involuntary combat action:** If a Sanity roll is failed during a combat round, the investigator’s action for that round may be dictated by the Keeper; for example, lashing out with a fist, squeezing a trigger, taking shelter behind someone else.
	* **Freeze:** Stare disbelievingly for a moment but take no action.
* **Fumbles** cause investigators to lose maximum points.
