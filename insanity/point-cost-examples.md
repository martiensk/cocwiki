# Sanity Loss Effects
Points Lost | Effect
--- | ---
1—2 points | discomfort and unease, something gnawing at the corner of the mind—hardly noticeable, yet definitely there.
3—4 points | disgust, or the feeling that something is wrong here. This may manifest in vomiting, momentary stupefaction, or shivering.
5—9 points | fear, panic, or disorientation—enough to cause a potential episode of temporary insanity. This represents a major shock leading to uncontrollable physical reactions (violent body ticks, extreme nausea, etc.) and/or disassociation with surroundings and people.
10—19 points | mind-warping horror—hair changes to white, violent physical reaction (to self and/or others), physical and mental shutdown, sudden character change (temporary), raving and delusions, or propensity to either violence or total fear.
20+ points | ultimate cosmic evil—beyond humanity’s ability to comprehend. The mind is broken and will take a long time to return to sanity, and even if a way can be found, the person will never be the same again. Results in certain indefinite insanity.
