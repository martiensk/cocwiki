# Psychic attack
Psychic attacks consist of a POW vs. POW opposed roll:
	• If the attacker overcomes the target’s POW: the target loses 1D10 magic points.
	• If the target overcomes the attacker’s POW: the attacker loses 1D10 magic points. 
	
If the attacker's magic points reach 0, the attacker faints until 1 MP is recovered (If it is a ghost nothing happens). The attack stops.
If the targets MP reaches 0 the attacker may possess the target. (Spiritual Possession)
