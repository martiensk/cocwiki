# Creating a new gadget
If a hero wants to build a gadget not normally available, they must first acquire the necessary components, as well as have appropriate facilities and tools. This may impact their available spending level, requiring them to turn assets into cash or credit, or engage in nefarious activities like stealing components.

Gadgets may perform only one function, and may require a single or combined skill roll. 
The time taken depends on the gadget. (1d6 hours/days for regular, 1d6 weeks/months for hard, 1d6 1/2 years / years for extreme.
Some gadgets may require the creator to be insane, or may have the difficulty adjusted for insane characters. 

**Regular difficulty:** 
* Performs one simple, non-destructive function.
* Replicates a skill roll at 40% chance of success (allowing a non-skilled person a 40% skill roll).

**Hard difficulty:**
* Performs one complex or destructive function (e.g. a weapon).
* Replicates a skill roll at 60% chance of success.
* Provides a bonus die to a specific skill roll, limited by 1D4 maximum uses.

**Extreme difficulty:**
* Performs one highly complex function.
* Performs one bizarre function.
* Replicates a skill roll at 90% chance of success.
* Provides a bonus die to a specific skill roll, limited by 1D10 maximum uses.
* Involves anything Mythos-related.

**Some possible outcomes for failed pushed rolls include:**
* The gadget functions for a limited time but there is a high risk of it exploding without warning: the user must make a Luck roll each time the device is used, with failure indicating the gadget has exploded, causing 1D6 damage to the user, and all within five feet.
* The gadget explodes in a ball of fire, causing between 2D10 and 4D10 damage to all within 10-feet.
* The gadget does not work as intended, there is a serious side effect, or it performs in a dangerous and unexpected manner.
